    <section class="aboutMe">
        I have a degree in computer science and a web developer who has been passionate about technology since I had my
        first computer. My fascination with this field has grown steadily over the years, fueled by a relentless desire
        to learn all things computer science. However, it was when I discovered programming that really captivated me.
        Programming not only allows me to exploit my creativity, but also put my problem-solving skills into practice. I
        love facing challenges and finding solutions through code. It is gratifying to be able to materialize ideas and
        solutions using different programming languages, frameworks and technological tools.
